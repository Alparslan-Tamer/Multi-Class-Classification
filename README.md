# Classification with CNN for Traffic Signs
* In this repository, there are codes and explanations about how to classify multi-class datasets with **Tensorflow, Keras and Pytorch**. Specifically, traffic signs were used. The dataset belongs to us and is fully balanced, so the performance in training is high, and the approximate accuracy is 99%.
